<p>This was a game that I created for my final year project at college. It is a fully motion controlled game on mobile.
 Overall, it is a simple game, but it took a long time to properly implement the gyroscopic controls to allow for the perfect controlling of the ball. 
 It took me a months to create, as I had to teach myself Unity and C# to create it, 
 along with the help of a mentor I had that was a developer in a local game development studio.
 The aim of the game is to get the ball from the outside of the map into the middle to collect the spinning coin.
 Through the maze, you need to avoid the flashing yellow lasers, and collecting the different coloured balls to allow you to
 move on to the next level. It is not perfect, but as my first look into mobile game design, I am very proud of it </p>
<p>If you would like to play the game yourself, please press the below image of the logo to download the .apk for it. </p>
